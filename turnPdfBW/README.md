This app is about converting a PDF into a black and white version of it.

## How does the need arised?
06 Jan 2025: Someone asked passport bio pages and I didn't want to share the color passport. If they have ot have it, why give them an exact relica: Make it a little bit difficult for them to misuse.

I know it can be done manually within minutes. But there're too many and it never stops. It's not pleasant.

So this is what this app does: It takes a PDF and create a copy but each pages will be turn into B&W version of it. The size of generated PDF must always be less the original. Ideally make the size as low as possible without reducing quality.

So idea is this: Turn a PDF or collection of PDFs into it's B&W version
